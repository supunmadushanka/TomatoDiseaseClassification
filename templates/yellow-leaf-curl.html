    <h5 class="header center green-text">Introduction</h5>
    <p style="font-size: 17px;line-hight: 5px">
        Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is a plant virus that primarily affects tomato plants, but can also infect other plants in the family Solanaceae. It is transmitted by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci and causes a range of symptoms in infected plants, including yellowing and curling of the leaves, stunted growth, and reduced fruit production. TYLCV is a serious threat to tomato production in many parts of the world, and control measures are necessary to prevent economic damage to farmers.

    <h5 class="header center green-text">Identification</h5>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-size: 17px;margin-left: 15px;list-style-type: square;">Symptoms of TYLCV include yellowing and curling of the leaves, upward curling of the leaf margins, and reduced leaf size</li>
        <li style="font-size: 17px;margin-left: 15px;list-style-type: square;">Infected plants may also exhibit stunted growth and reduced fruit production</li>
        <li style="font-size: 17px;margin-left: 15px;list-style-type: square;">Laboratory tests such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to detect the virus in plant tissue</li>
        <li style="font-size: 17px;margin-left: 15px;list-style-type: square;">Visual inspection and monitoring of plants for the presence of whiteflies can also help to identify potential sources of infection</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h5 class="header center green-text">Managing and Treatment</h5>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-size: 17px;margin-left: 15px;list-style-type: square;">Use resistant tomato varieties, as some varieties have been bred to resist the virus</li>
        <li style="font-size: 17px;margin-left: 15px;list-style-type: square;">Use insecticides to control whiteflies and reduce the spread of TYLCV; follow label instructions to prevent the development of insecticide resistance</li>
        <li style="font-size: 17px;margin-left: 15px;list-style-type: square;">Cultural practices such as crop rotation and weed control can help to reduce the spread of TYLCV by minimizing the presence of the insect vector</li>
        <li style="font-size: 17px;margin-left: 15px;list-style-type: square;">Monitor crops for signs of infection and take action quickly to prevent the spread of the virus</li>
        <li style="font-size: 17px;margin-left: 15px;list-style-type: square;">Remove and destroy infected plants to prevent further spread of the virus</li>
        <li style="font-size: 17px;margin-left: 15px;list-style-type: square;">Practice good hygiene by cleaning tools and equipment to reduce the risk of virus transmission between plants</li>
    </ul>
